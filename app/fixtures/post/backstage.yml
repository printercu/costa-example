  Costa uses [CoffeClasskit](https://github.com/printercu/coffee_classkit) for
  inheritance. In a nutshell it implements inheritance of class methods using
  prototype chain. It also inherits properties that were set with
  `Object.defineProperty`. More about features of classkit you can find in the repo.

  There is a lot of interesting stuff but i have no more time to write about it
  before NKO4 ends :)

  Thanks for reading!
